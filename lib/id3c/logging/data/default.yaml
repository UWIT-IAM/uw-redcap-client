  # Filtering of messages by level is done at the handler level by using NOTSET
  # on the root logger to emit everything.  This lets us keep console output
  # readable while emitting verbose output to alternate handlers.

loggers:
  # The SmartyStreets library uses urllib3, which produces DEBUG messages that
  # can contain sensitive data.  Suppress those at its package logger.
  urllib3:
    level: INFO

  # Ditto with various sub-loggers of botocore, which DEBUG out various
  # slightly sensitive things.
  botocore:
    level: INFO

  # But useful to see in logs _where_ credentials were found (env, config, etc)
  botocore.credentials:
    level: DEBUG

  # s3fs sets up a logger with its own console handler, which is bad practice
  # for a library because it subverts the application's (our!) logging config.
  # Set its level to ours.
  s3fs:
    level: !coalesce
      - !LOG_LEVEL
      - INFO

handlers:

  # This handler emits all log levels; filtering is more usefully done by
  # syslog itself.
